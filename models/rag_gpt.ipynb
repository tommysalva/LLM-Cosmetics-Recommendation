The synergy of the 3 beauty vitamins (A,C,E) accelerates cell turnover, brightens the complexion, stimulates the production of collagen and elastin and protects them from the harmful action of free radicals. The results are visible from the first applications: the skin immediately appears softer, more radiant, compact and revitalized. Recommended for: Thickened, dull and dull skin with a need for brightness and vitality. For those who spend a lot of time outdoors and need a cocktail of protective antioxidants. For everyone after winter and before summer: it awakens brightness and good color of the skin and prepares it for the summer season.

The synergy of 3 hydroxy acids (glycolic, lactic, citric) makes the product very effective and well tolerated. The results are visible from the first applications: the skin immediately appears smoother, brighter, more compact, as if regenerated. Constant use for at least 2 months allows you to obtain notable improvements in microwrinkles, tone and skin texture. Given the presence of hydroxy acids, it is important to observe some simple general rules: Avoid contact with eyes and the area around the eyes. Avoid using the products in case of prolonged exposure to the sun or tanning lamps. Avoid use on particularly delicate or couperose skin. A slight burning sensation is normal, especially at the first applications, and is linked to the effectiveness of the product, but it should regress spontaneously in a few days. Usage Instructions: Apply in the evening to perfectly cleansed skin and massage gently until completely absorbed.
