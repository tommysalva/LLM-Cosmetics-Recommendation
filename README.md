# LLM-Cosmetics-Recommendation
This repository contains the code and data for evaluating large language models for cosmetics product recommendations. The project is conducted in collaboration with Dorabruschi, a small cosmetics company in Florence, Italy. The study aims to explore the potential of LLMs in building a cosmetics routine recommendation system, addressing cold-start problems with limited historical customer-product data.

## Repository Structure

- `models/`: Contains the trained models and configuration files.

## Models Evaluated

1. Custom GPT-4
2. GPT-3.5-Turbo with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)
3. Fine-tuned GPT-3.5-Turbo
